## Directroy

### Hayden Duet Concertina

These pieces were arranged for the Elise Hayden Duet Concertina, from
Concertina Connection.  These pieces will likely play fine on other key
layouts, although I don't have any other layouts to test them on.

#### Video Game Music

* [Song of Storms (The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time)](https://github.com/Dorthu/music/blob/master/games/Song_of_Storms.pdf)

#### Christmas Songs

* [Deck the Halls](https://github.com/Dorthu/music/blob/master/christmas/Deck_The_Halls.pdf)
* [Let it Snow](https://github.com/Dorthu/music/blob/master/christmas/Let_It_Snow.pdf)

### Maccann Duet Concertina

These pieces were arranged for an antique 47-key Maccann Duet Concertina from
Lachenal, cira the mid 1890.  These may well play fine on other instrumnets,
but I make no gaurentee.  Versions of the Hayden Duet songs rearranged here are
often in a different key to account for the different range of the instrument,
and I've modified the clefs to match [Maccann's book on the
subject](https://imslp.org/wiki/Method_for_the_Chromatic_Duet_English_Concertina_%28Maccann%2C_John_Hill%29).

#### General Music

 * [Somewhere In Between (Interlude) by Streetlight Manifest](https://github.com/Dorthu/music/blob/master/wip/Somewher_In_Between%20%28Interlude%29.pdf).

#### Chirstmas Songs

 * [Let it Snow (key of C)](https://github.com/Dorthu/music/blob/master/christmas/Let_It_Snow_C.pdf).

### Cello

My son picked up the Cello for school, so I've included some arrangements here
that I made for him.

#### Video Game Music

* [Song of Storms](https://github.com/Dorthu/music/blob/master/games/Song_of_Storms_Cello.pdf)

#### Christmas Songs

* [O come, O come, Emmanuel](https://github.com/Dorthu/music/blob/master/christmas/O_come_O_come_Emmanuel_Cello.pdf)
